Frame is complete. Certain builds on YouTube just overcomplicated the build. At this point, I need a framework to work with since implementation of the requirements is fundemental to this game. I plan on using the A.I. from the tic-tac-toe build. Then work on my minimax A.I. That is the goal with this project. Styling, all of that other stuff, while nice, isn't as impressive as a working A.I. in one of these games. After that, I'd like to implement some of the stretch goals, especially with snake. 

cykage and wayneTaller on websight.blue where saying to simplify my win conditions by writing a check for win algorithm instead of hardcoding it in the tic-tac-toe build. 

Set variable declarations to var instead of const/let for hoisting.

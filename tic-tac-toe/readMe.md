As users playing a two player game we want to:

enter our names and have them displayed

CHECKED have our order chosen for us by the game

CHECKED take turns placing our marks in empty spaces

CHECKED COMPLETELY not be able to place our marks in an occupied space

CHECKED be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw

CHECKED start the game over without having to reset the browser

As a user playing a one player game I want to:

see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space
As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:

have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3)

I have a functional A.I. but it is not minimax. Due to time constraints I will go back and change it to a minimax system. Until then I will continue with this basic A.I. system. I have to give credit to help from friends online with this portion. And though I am trying to not use chatGPT for anything, it has helped finding systanx errors, especially in this area where I have never implemented something before. A crutch is still a crutch, and one I need to abandon.

I will officially call this game "gold".

I also kept it simple and elegant, which was my ultimate goal on this project.
